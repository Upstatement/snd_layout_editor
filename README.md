# SND Layout Editor
=================

A seamless way to get a handle on your homepage.

This is a demo that was built as part of SND Makes: Boston.

### The problem
How might we make content creation fun and accessible to anyone in the newsroom? 


How can we make managing complex page designs easier and more accessible in a visual way interface?

### Who built this?

### What is it?

This tool allows an editor to dynamically arrange and edit a complex web layout (like a homepage). In theory, a user would be able to: 

- Drag and drop content into layout
- Rearrange content within a layout
- Show how layout changes as you add and subtract content
- Choose from a recently published story queue
- Edit headlines, teaser text, and make modest changes to images

This also needs to hook into many disparate CMSes.

### Challenges and questions
- Could we change the templates dynamically?
- Is democratizing homepage design to this degree dangerous?
- Can we have presets and limits (e.g., only certain roles can move blocks)?
- Is the preview responsive?
- Would it make sense to apply to topic pages and/or article pages?
- How can this fit into various CMS?

### What still needs to happen
Probably a lot!

- Build a way to version homepages and rollback changes
- Build functionality to schedule homepages/designs
- TBD
