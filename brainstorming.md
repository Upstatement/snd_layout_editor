# Brainstorming notes

---

Below are rough notes from our many hours of conversation before we landed on a final idea. In the spirit of showing our work, we thought it would be valuable to share the process and thinking that led to hmpgr.

Creating connections  
How to make hyperlink more useful (integrating contextual content)  
Wysiwyg, aggregating content relevant to story  
How might we connect content  
How video interacts with text, etc. Gifs as video pull quotes  
Making editorial decision making transparent  
Evolution of the story  
  
#### How might we statements for initial report back
How might we connect content in a meaningful and produce stories within existing narrative  

The problem of the hyperlink  
**How might we integrate contextual content in a better way?** 
 
**How might we make contextual content more useful for readers — whether that is links, videos, footnotes — in a way that doesn't detract from the narrative**

**How might we answer questions people are asking about the news (micro and macro)?** 

**How might we bring readers into our editorial decision making process — and let them participate as the story evolves**

**How might we incorporate past analytics/gleanings into future content creation? (CMS teaching how to best produce/publish content)**  

**How might we make a content creation process fun and accessible to anyone in the newsroom** 
 
**How might we get rid of web producers?**


**How to augment current story w/ embedded info vs. what's the next story**

How to enable editors to add context in a systematic/programatic way?


####Then we went back to the drawing board

Intersection of news and people with phones in their hand — how UGC. 

**How might we use community needs to drive the existing news?**


**How might we make a content creation process fun and accessible to anyone in the newsroom** 
 
**How might we get rid of web producers?**  

Focus on assets/multimedia? 

Tool to drop link into tweet, but wouldn't be a specific story (more like a story stream)

How might we capture twitter audience  

How might we enable reporters/editors to post breaking news on social media that will also be integrated onto our news site

How can we make videos more digestible?


**How might we make a content creation process fun and accessible to anyone in the newsroom** 

**How can we add joy to the content creation process?**

**Focusing on the assets — how do we make it easier for everyone in the news room to produce web content with assets?**

Potential problems: Writers don't want to write in the CMS. "The CMS isn't for writing"

Separating the publish button from the writing process (make people feel safe)


Gamification of CMS

Feedback within CMS that you're doing well (progress bars, thumbs up)

Text being secondary to CMS/content creation

Drag and drop interface where you can just grab things from anywhere and add them. Have prompt like "what is this? block of text/tweet/photo (what's the source?)"

Who is already doing this?

Presentation layer/design tool. Move things around see how they change dynamically. Designing the landing/home pages and such (also story pages?)

Intermediary step before publishing (but is not just a preview)


Allows more people to have access to page design.
Presentation layer/design tool for homepage or more complicated multi-story pages. (Hey can you add art and put this on the homepage)
